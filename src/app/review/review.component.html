      The staff is very helpful, and knowledgeable about the items in stock.
      Great selection of organic foods and an amazing wellness department."

      Great independent grocery store with a wide variety of gourmet items and
      hard to find food stuffs. A great butcher offering local seafood and grass
      fed meats. There a good variety of organic fruits and vegetables but not
      always the freshest (but I'll admit I'm comparing to local farmer's
      markets). Best grocery store in Santa Cruz.

      Staff allows me to live out my dreams of becoming a zero-waster. The best
      bulk selection around. Organic, beautiful produce. Better than your
      grandmas pot-pie. Gourmet cheese samples nearly every weekend. Hot meals
      on the go. What more could you ask for? We. Are. In. Love. Plus we love
      the staff.. seriously! This spot is a gem.

      This is the best local independently owned health food store in Santa Cruz
      county. They will have the best prices and you will be able to find the
      most unique hard to find items here as well. You will feel much better
      supporting a local company.

      plenty of seating.Convenient location near freeway and public

      Plenty of wholesome foods to find at this place, bulk and non-bulk. They
      make some great burritos at the deli. There's a dude named McKinnely that
      will build your sandwich or burrito with white-glove customer service.
      Even if you simply go for the deli experience or the amazing cheese
      selection, Staff of Life is the place for earthy delectable.
